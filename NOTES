The Ir tree must be independant of the iptables rules - It should be possible to make a userspace firewall, disabling the iptables rule generation.


Steps:
Extend the iptables emitter to allow multiple conditions of the same type
Change inlining to be dumb.
Change merging to be more efficient - But is must not emit new rules. Still check for impossible rules.
