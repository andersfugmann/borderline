* Require one rule for each zone definition. (add a rule stm to the zone struct)
* Add comments about source rule. Extend rule to contain position info.
* Allow ip and port definitions (Series that will be or'ed)

* Setup wiki page for borderline.
* Extend ip address notation to include '::'
* Move implementation to .ml and types to .mli

* Add ipv4 support - Somehow. Maybe by adding a switch, and by using the same framework but disallowing ipv6 constructs. The validation pass must validate the all rules to be allowed. Also a mangle filter must be present for ipv4 firewalling.
