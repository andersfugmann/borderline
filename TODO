In progress: 
* Extend source / destination addresses to be lists. 
* Allow ip definitions (Series that will be or'ed)
* Change Port definitions to be Int list definitions, and allow these definitions everywhere an int is used.

* Move implementation to .ml and types to .mli - Need to figure out
  how to avoid type definition redundancy.

Future:  
* Add comments about source rule. Extend rule to contain position
  info.

* Setup wiki page for borderline.  

* Extend ip address notation to include '::'

Planning:
* Add ipv4 support - Somehow. Maybe by adding a switch, and by using
  the same framework but disallowing ipv6 constructs. The validation
  pass must validate the all rules to be allowed. Also a mangle filter
  must be present for ipv4 firewalling.

* Define strategy about Mangle and Nat tables. It may require a
  seperate tree, with special validation and optimization passes. It
  will also require cha ins to be locked to a specific table, which it
  is currently not. Table creation could take a parent table and
  inherit the table info.


# To create a checkpoint do:
tar zvcf checkpoint1.tar.gz TODO src/*.{ml,mli} src/*bl src/test/*.bl

Consider using git for development rather than svn.
